Mouse following platformer demo
===============================

This is a small demo to show how a platformer character could be controlled by a mouse, in a way that would be intuitive and fun for non gamers. The character would also naturally follow as the user browsed the page.


## TODO

- intra platform navigation
- update algorithm to take platform distance into account
- add maximum fall distance
- add 'thinking time'
